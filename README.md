# MLMusicParser

## Now being rewritten in Python as part of my self-learning plan

A piece of Python code that parses the information of all the music from game Idolm@ster Million Live! along with the official samples m4a links to them that are provided in its official mobile game.

It will group the songs in CDs with associated information related to each CD including link to the CD Cover.

## How to Use
To get started, log in into game (you do need an account), open the page of audio room (http://imas.gree-apps.net/app/index.php/audio_room), and save the webpage as "ml.html". Put it in same directory as the python script.
